## Rulebook
Hello there general. You have been chosen to fight against the incoming alien monsters. We have tried our best to hold them so far. Your job now is to place our newly designed towers to defeat the oncoming enemies!
You have 7 different towers that you can use. Each has a unique feature of its own!: ", 20,
 - Patrol Tower: This tower shoots the bullet projectile at enemies in range.
 - Laser Turret: This tower continuously tracks and beams at enemies in range.
 - Magic Portal: This tower both damages enemies in range and teleports them back if charge-up is done.
 - Resource Mine: This tower mines resources so we can fund the construction of all towers. If minerals are in range, extra profit is made!
 - Submarine: Submarines tour the waters and fire at enemies in range.
 - Tooth Trap: This trap harms enemies that come in contact with it.
 - Monster Net: This net slows enemies for a short time that come in contact with it.

There are 4 unique map assets that may appear while you play:
 - Minerals: This asset has a mineral icon and placing mines in range will increase profits!
 - Acid_74: Watch out! This leaked lab experiment heals monsters as they come in range!
